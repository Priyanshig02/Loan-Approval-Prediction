# Loan-Approval-Prediction

### What is a loan prediction system?
A mechanism called the Loan Prediction System allows you to apply for loans and receive notifications when they are approved. By the data provided by the applicant, the system notifies the applicant of the loan's availability.

## OVERVIEW 

In this project, we explored various machine learning algorithms to predict loan approval status. We implemented and evaluated the following models:

> K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

> Naive Bayes

> Decision Tree (DT)

> Random Forest

> Logistic Regression

After comparing their accuracies, we found that the Naive Bayes classifier provided the best performance. Therefore, we concluded that the Naive Bayes classifier is the most suitable model for loan approval prediction in this case.
